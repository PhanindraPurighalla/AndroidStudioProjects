# AndroidStudioProjects

This is a sample SignUp and Login mobile application using AndroidStudio to develop the front end components.

The code is still in a very nascent state, with hard-coded elements and commented lines of code, thereby making it far from industry-standard at the moment. This said, it may help anyone just starting out on mobile application development like myself to have a starting point.
